TODO: Plans for the work
=========================

Initial ideas / purpose of project.

	Create text web forum API / DB
	(USER FLOWS)
	- Users can create posts 
	- Users can write comments on posts
		- Investigate nested comments **
	- Users can like comments once per post, not their own.
	- A separate user type of moderator can tag posts for being misleading or false
	- Users can log into the system to gain access to write posts or comments
	- Anon can read posts
	
Extra notes
	- Small scale < 100 users
	- System auth required
	- Integrable API needs to be provided 
	- MVC -> rudimentary UI
